## 👋 About Me

I'm a Senior Manager whose 11+ year journey has taken me through the diverse landscapes of cybersecurity, AI, and data analytics. From the compliance-heavy world of banking and telecommunications to the innovation-driven environments of consulting and product tech firms, I've honed my expertise in risk management, cloud engineering, and software development. What drives me most is the opportunity to build and create—because despite my management role, I remain an engineer at heart with an insatiable passion for turning ideas into reality. I bring the unique advantage of having skills from both worlds: developing robust solutions and then securing them through a comprehensive risk lens for business.
